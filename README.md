# Micro-Reddit

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Ruby on Rails curriculum. The goal of the project is to build a simple clone of Reddit using Ruby on Rails to practice and strengthen our skills in building web applications.

Micro-Reddit is a simple Reddit clone built with Ruby on Rails, which allows users to create posts, comment on them, and like/dislike them. The project aims to provide hands-on experience with various aspects of Ruby on Rails, including:

- MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture
- Relationships between models (such as `User`, `Post`, and `Comment`)
- Basic form handling
- Routing and URL structure
- Validations and error handling
